# Handling-Imbalance-Data-Set

Handling imbalanced data sets in machine learning is a common challenge that arises when the number of instances in one class is much smaller than the number of instances in the other class. Imbalanced data sets can lead to biased models that perform poorly on the minority class.


## Here are some strategies for handling imbalanced data sets:

### Collect more data: 
The first and most obvious solution is to collect more data. By collecting more data for the minority class, the imbalance can be reduced, which can lead to better performance.

### Resampling techniques:
Resampling techniques are used to balance the data set by oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or a combination of both. Oversampling involves creating new instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves removing instances from the majority class.

### Ensemble methods: 
Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models to make a final prediction. By training multiple models on different subsets of the data, ensemble methods can improve the performance of the model on the minority class.

### Using appropriate evaluation metrics: 
When dealing with imbalanced data sets, accuracy is not always the best metric to evaluate the model's performance. Other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC can provide a better understanding of the model's performance on the minority class.

Overall, the choice of method to handle imbalanced data sets depends on the specific characteristics of the data set and the problem at hand. It is often necessary to try multiple techniques and evaluate their performance to determine the best approach.


# Under Sampling
Undersampling is a resampling technique used to address the issue of imbalanced datasets, where one class is significantly smaller than the other. Undersampling aims to balance the class distribution by reducing the number of samples in the majority class to match that of the minority class.

## Random Undersampling
This can be done in several ways. One simple method is random undersampling, where data points from the majority class are randomly removed until the class distribution is balanced. This can be effective when the majority class has a significant number of redundant or noisy data points. 
However, random undersampling can also result in loss of information, and important features or patterns may be missed.

## Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN) undersampling
Another approach is to use more strategic undersampling techniques, such as cluster-based undersampling or condensed nearest neighbor (CNN) undersampling.

While undersampling can be effective in improving the balance of the class distribution, it can also result in loss of information and may not always produce the best results. Therefore, it is often necessary to try multiple techniques and evaluate their performance to determine the best approach for the specific dataset and problem at hand.

# Over-Sampling
Oversampling is a resampling technique used to address the issue of imbalanced datasets, where one class is significantly smaller than the other. Oversampling aims to balance the class distribution by increasing the number of samples in the minority class to match that of the majority class.

### Random oversampling
This can be done in several ways. One simple method is random oversampling, where data points from the minority class are randomly duplicated until the class distribution is balanced. This can be effective when the minority class has a significant number of unique and valuable data points. However, random oversampling can also result in overfitting and may not generalize well to new data.

### SMOTE
Another approach is to use more strategic oversampling techniques, such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). SMOTE is a data synthesis technique that generates new synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between pairs of existing minority class data points. This approach helps to create synthetic minority samples that better represent the true distribution of the minority class and can improve the generalization of the model.

### Dis-advantages
While oversampling can be effective in improving the balance of the class distribution and enhancing the performance of the classifier, it can also result in overfitting and may not always produce the best results. Therefore, it is often necessary to try multiple techniques and evaluate their performance to determine the best approach for the specific dataset and problem at hand.






# Whether to use Over or Under Sampling?

Deciding whether to use undersampling or oversampling (or a combination of both) depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand. Here are some factors to consider:

__Class imbalance ratio__

If the class imbalance ratio is relatively small, i.e., the difference between the number of instances in the minority class and majority class is not very significant, then oversampling may be more appropriate.

__Data size__

If the dataset is small, then undersampling may be more appropriate, as oversampling may lead to overfitting and generalization issues.

__Nature of the data__

The nature of the data can also influence the choice of resampling technique. For example, if the dataset is noisy or contains many irrelevant data points, then undersampling may be more appropriate. On the other hand, if the minority class has a significant number of unique and valuable data points, then oversampling may be more appropriate.

__Evaluation metrics__

The evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of the model can also influence the choice of resampling technique. For example, if the focus is on minimizing false positives, then undersampling may be more appropriate, as it helps to reduce the influence of the majority class. On the other hand, if the focus is on maximizing recall or sensitivity, then oversampling may be more appropriate, as it helps to improve the representation of the minority class.
